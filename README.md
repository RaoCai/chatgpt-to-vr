# Gemini to VR

## Overview

This is a VR project based on Unity for Oculus Quest 3 devices. The program introduces Gemini conversational query capabilities into the VR environment, thus realizing the Gardener metaphor for deliberative investigation in VR.

Users can enter questions by voice or text, and Gemini will respond according to a specific format. 
The response content is arranged in a 2D tree diagram in the form of message bubbles, accompanied by a 3D tree that intuitively reflects the complexity of the query. 
Users can click on the message node to view details and perform further operations, such as obtaining extended information or pruning specific nodes.
